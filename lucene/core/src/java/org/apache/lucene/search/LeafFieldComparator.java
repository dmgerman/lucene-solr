comment|/**  * Expert: comparator that gets instantiated on each leaf  * from a top-level {@link FieldComparator} instance.  *  *<p>A leaf comparator must define these functions:</p>  *  *<ul>  *  *<li> {@link #setBottom} This method is called by  *       {@link FieldValueHitQueue} to notify the  *       FieldComparator of the current weakest ("bottom")  *       slot.  Note that this slot may not hold the weakest  *       value according to your comparator, in cases where  *       your comparator is not the primary one (ie, is only  *       used to break ties from the comparators before it).  *  *<li> {@link #compareBottom} Compare a new hit (docID)  *       against the "weakest" (bottom) entry in the queue.  *  *<li> {@link #compareTop} Compare a new hit (docID)  *       against the top value previously set by a call to  *       {@link FieldComparator#setTopValue}.  *  *<li> {@link #copy} Installs a new hit into the  *       priority queue.  The {@link FieldValueHitQueue}  *       calls this method when a new hit is competitive.  *  *</ul>  *  * @see FieldComparator  * @lucene.experimental  */
