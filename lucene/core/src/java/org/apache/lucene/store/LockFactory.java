comment|/**  *<p>Base class for Locking implementation.  {@link Directory} uses  * instances of this class to implement locking.</p>  *  *<p>Lucene uses {@link NativeFSLockFactory} by default for  * {@link FSDirectory}-based index directories.</p>  *  *<p>Special care needs to be taken if you change the locking  * implementation: First be certain that no writer is in fact  * writing to the index otherwise you can easily corrupt  * your index. Be sure to do the LockFactory change on all Lucene  * instances and clean up all leftover lock files before starting  * the new configuration for the first time. Different implementations  * can not work together!</p>  *  *<p>If you suspect that some LockFactory implementation is  * not working properly in your environment, you can easily  * test it by using {@link VerifyingLockFactory}, {@link  * LockVerifyServer} and {@link LockStressTest}.</p>  *  * @see LockVerifyServer  * @see LockStressTest  * @see VerifyingLockFactory  */
