comment|/**  * An Aggregator is the analogue of Lucene's Collector (see  * {@link org.apache.lucene.search.Collector}), for processing the categories  * belonging to a certain document. The Aggregator is responsible for doing  * whatever it wishes with the categories it is fed, e.g., counting the number  * of times that each category appears, or performing some computation on their  * association values.  *<P>  * Much of the function of an Aggregator implementation is not described by this  * interface. This includes the constructor and getter methods to retrieve the  * results of the aggregation.  *   * @lucene.experimental  */
